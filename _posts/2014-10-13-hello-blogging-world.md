## Go go go!!!
so after several months(if not years) of procrastinating whether I should blog or not, I've finally decided to leave my comfort zone and face
my greatest fear - blogging!!

I've been 'blogging' locally on my laptop & workstation just taking simple notes of problems I've faced & how I tackled them. 
On few cases, I would place these notes on private gist in [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com), then I would share them with my co-workers.

I guess it's time to go public & share everything with everyone out there, after all I'm a big fan on Free & Open Source Software(FOSS).

Watch this space for more to come!

_Adios_
